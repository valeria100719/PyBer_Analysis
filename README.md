# PyBer_Analysis


## Overview 

The aim of this report is to create a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type.
Using different tools like:Pandas and Matplotlib libraries, I was able to create a report that include multiple-line graphs of total weekly fares for each city type.


## Results

In the graph of the fig1, it is shown the distinct separation of Rural, Urban and Suburban city types.  
The number of total rides are higher for Urban respect to Rural.

The data analysis of fig2, confirmed these data.

## Discussion

This data report show hoe the urban fares and riders are much more elevated respect to Rural and Suburban data.
The Urban fares start at average of $1,600 and continued to increase as the months went by to ~$2,400.  
The Suburban fares are the middle one, and they started around $1,000, the trend was not consistently stable as the fare dropped lower in the middle  of April.  The Rural fares is the lowest one, it started at around $200, and it was consistent a low fare until the end of April.
In all the data there is a peak at the end of Febraury, meaning that for that period there was a little increase of total fares in all Urban, Suburban and Rural rides.
